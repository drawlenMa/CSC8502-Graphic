At the beginning ,there is an animation of the whole scene.(automatic)
when it stop, 
press 5 :change to view of robot
press 6 :move by user
I change the bumpFregment shader to use two lights,
one is on the map
one light is following the monster
In fact the floor behind the yellow wall is the other scene at the beginning design but now it is just the platform of camera. 

I have changed the time to control the blink of eyes. In different movement of eyes, there is different light on the map.
I have added the monster on the map to walk, and set the distance.
There are different cuberobots on the map. They are in different mesh there for their types are different.
The water can reflact the picture of the skybox.
I set another floor texture as the floor.
the texture of the heightmap

if the light follow the monster and the light in a same place, the first light will cover the second light(Colour grading)
the light can move with monster(Direction light)
the water is transparent(Correct rendering of transparent objects)
there are two lights on the map(Effective use of extra shader stages)
and the fragment shader was be changed(Fragment shader effects)
the monster(Skeletal animation in scene)


Because I typed the code on vs2022,  I tried to put the programme on computer on school, it was not campatible.
I put the exe.programme in the :CSC8502 2022 - Zhaolong Ma\Blank Project\Blank Project.exe.    it worked.
